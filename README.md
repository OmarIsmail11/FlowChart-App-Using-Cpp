## Installation
Note: To run the game, make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
1. Clone the repository
```
 https://github.com/OmarIsmail11/FlowChart-App-Using-Cpp.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```
 cd FolderName
```
3. In Visual Studio run the main.cpp file

Note: Make Sure all the source files are downloaded and as sometimes some of the project folders aren't all loaded in Visual Studio and results in a Linker error (LNK).
If this error occured, copy the missing source files in VS from the folder itself (project directory) and paste in VS manually. This may happen in statements & actions files.
